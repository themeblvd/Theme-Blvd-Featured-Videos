== Description ==

When using a theme with Theme Blvd framework version 2.0.5+, this plugin is will allow you to replace featured images with videos.

= How does it work? =

When you install and activate this plugin, you'll notice that a new option gets added to framework's standard "Post Options" meta box that you see when editing a post. This option will allow you to switch out the featured image on the particular post you're editing with a video. You can then insert a video URL compatible with WordPress's built-in oEmbed features. 

This video will then get inserted where you would normally see a featured image for that post wherever it's set to show such as post lists, post grids, single posts, etc. And because you're working with a Theme Blvd theme, this video will also, of course, be respsonsive with the rest of the theme.

= Why would I use this plugin? =

This would be a cool plugin for anyone that likes posting a lot of videos. 

If you're someone who posts videos to a blog (or "Post List" as we call it in the theme framework) and you like the compact look of showing excerpts in that blog, this will work nicely for you. By using this you can still show excerpts from your Post List options, but also combine that with showing videos in the blog roll and then automatically at the top of the single posts.

I envision this plugin also being used by people that want to setup some sort of video portfolio. Currently in the theme framework, if you're going for this, your only real option is to setup a post grid and then set all the featured images to link to a video in a lightbox popup. However, by installing this plugin, you could potentially have all the posts in that grid show the videos right there on your video portfolio page, and thus eliminate the need for the user to keep clicking and opening up lightboxes.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `theme-blvd-featured-videos` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==
